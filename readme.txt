tribe is a conversion plugin which turns a normal Wordpress installation into a team management site for competitive video game teams.

== Description ==

tribe aims to provide team leaders with all the tools they'll need in order to maintain a web presence for their team.  It provides both public facing pages and widgets as well as the administration screens to manage members, matches, etc.

Currently in development, this plugin will see rapid change as it is developed alongside [my team's web site](http://www.teaminq.com/).

Planned features include

* Roster and member profile management integrated with Wordpress' existing user system.
* Enhanced user profiles including photo, location, age, system specs, and team specific info (date joined, favorite loadout, etc).
* Member blogs so that your team members can have their own voice on their teams site.
* View your match history and plan your upcoming match by letting your members note their intent to attend.

Feel free to try it out the development version as-is, but please consider that until 1.0 it will be incomplete.

== Installation ==

1. Upload all plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/tribe/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Enjoy! Please read the detailed usage guide for more information

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What about MMO guilds? =

Currently the design of tribe is centered around competitive teams playing FPS games.  As the plugin matures, more general team management things may be introduced, but its focus will remain the same.  (i.e. I don't ever foresee a DKP system being coded into tribe)

Once I have some features written, this section will have something in it!
